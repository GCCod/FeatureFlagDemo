# FeatureFlagDemo
Use of Feature Flag with different values using Python SDK LaunchDarkly

This is a simple program that generates a movie quote based on a random number

It uses Python SDK launchdarkly-server-sdk 7.4.0 (Included in the requirements.txt file)

The file main.py includes comments to make more clear how the SDK is initialized and where the flag is evaluated

The feature flag should be configured in LaunchDarkly's Dashboard
